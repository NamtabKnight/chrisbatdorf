I needed a quick upturn on this. So I found an open source Bootstrap template with a "good set of bones" that I liked and could build off of. I've begun to add new content and replace the css with my own along with modifying any of the underlying code that I want to change or see needs improving.

I am working on the code locally in a Windows 10 environment, utilizing Netbeans IDE 8.2.
